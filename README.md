# ProjectCelestini_2019

This is the submission for my internship under Project Celestini 2019 on the theme Air Pollution.  
The idea was to develop a solution that relates traffic index to the air pollution.  

We have used TOM TOM API to gather traffic congestion time and traffic speeds for a particular stretch of road.  
More on TOM TOM API [here](https://developer.tomtom.com/traffic-api/traffic-api-documentation-traffic-flow/flow-segment-data)  

Traffic speed is obtained using TOMTOM API which provides 4 traffic parameters of the chosen section of the road (400 meters), namely free flow speed, free flow time,current traffic speed, current traffic time. The free flow time and traffic time refer to the time taken by a vehicle on an average to cross the section of the road at no congestion and current traffic conditions respectively.

The main focus was on the Ring Road in Delhi.  
Four locations were chosen on the Ring road which had pollution control centres nearby.  

1.Punjabi Bagh  
2.Mall Road(DU)  
3.Azadpur  
4.AIIMS
